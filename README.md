# Esp32-Development-Sim-Tool

## Project Overview
This web application provides an interactive interface for configuring ESP-32 microcontroller pins. The tool assists developers in properly setting up their ESP-32 projects by generating boilerplate code based on their pin configuration selections.

## Key Features
Visual Pin Selection Interface: Interactive representation of all ESP-32 pins with clear labeling

Pin Configuration System:

<p>Select from multiple functions (GPIO, I2C, SPI, UART, etc.)

Configure pin modes (digital input/output, analog, etc.)

Add custom names and descriptions for each pin

Code Generation:
